# Boop!

A small BHop script for CS:GO as an up-to-date demo. Using Win32 Api.


## Usage

```cmd
**Start CSGO. Possibly go ingame to avoid bugs**
Clone repo
Navigate to directory
python boop.py
```

#### VAC

The script writes direct values without opening a handle to csgo.exe. Didn't include HazeDumper purely to stay on such a low level of detection.

#### Disclaimer

This program is provided as is, without any warranty concerning the potential consequences on your steam account. Devs WILL eventually ban you when they manually browse logs.

Does not work on CS2
